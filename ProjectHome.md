## SoundGrain version 3 ##

-------- CSOUND REPLACED BY PYO --------

[Revision 180](https://code.google.com/p/soundgrain/source/detail?r=180) is a breaking compatilibity turn around. It's the starting point of version 3.0 and the end of MS Windows support. Csound have been replaced by [pyo](http://code.google.com/p/pyo) as the audio engine. pyo offers more flexibility for granulation process and the ability to build an App with all dependencies embeded. I hope you will enjoy!

## SoundGrain version 1 and 2 ##

Sound Grain v1.0 and v2.0 are written with Python and use Csound as their audio engine. Csound 5 must be installed on the system to allow Sound Grain to run.
